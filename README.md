# BoidsQuadtree

BoidsQuadtree is a small application written in C++ with OpenGL and ImGUI. The idea relies on the Boids algorithm developed by Craig Renolds which  simulates the flocking behavior of birds.

The birds' behaviour is governed by rules based on the behaviour of neighbouring birds. In order to only check the neighbouring birds and not all the birds in the simulation, a quadtree structure is implemented for more efficiency.
